Once upon a time, there existed a dog. The dog's name was Hog. No, this dog was not a hog but he did indeed live in a bog, precisely inside an empty log that he called home. Everyday, he starts his morning by eating soggy pancakes followed by a short jog around his backyard. But one day, he fell and hit his noggin very hard that Hog was compelled to drink egg nog, which he only drinks to recover from minor injuries.
